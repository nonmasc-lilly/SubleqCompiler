                === SUBLEQ ===
        See <https://esolangs.org/wiki/Subleq> for the specification.
        This Subleq compiler compiles from subleq to x86_64 linux assembly. We shall specify that
        an address is 16-bits wide, and each address locates a 16 bit word. So that: `0 0 -1` subtracts
        from the zeroth address itself, and then jumps to negative one (or $FFFF). This subleq compiler
        assumes that numbers are in twos complement so that: `-1` and `$FFFF` are identical addresses. 
        The following IO is mapped:
                A jump to $FFFF exits the program.
                A subtraction from $FFFF to an arbitrary address shall output that address to the
                        terminal, the contents of the applied address is unchanged and the ternary
                        operand shall always be jumped to.
        Note that decimal values are any number, prefixed zeroes do not change the meaning of a decimal
                value. A hexadecimal value is prefixed with `$`. 
        In other words:
                A $FFFF C --> OUT(*A); GOTO(C)
                A B $FFFF --> *A -= *B; IF *A <= 0 THEN EXIT()
                A B C     --> *A -= *B; IF *A <= 0 THEN GOTO(C)
        You may build the compiler with `make`, we can test the compiler with `make test`, and you may
        see the compiler help function by calling it with any sort of invalid arguments, for simplicity's
        sake: `subleqc`. The outputted program will be in x86_64 linux fasm assembly and may be built
        with `fasm <outputted name> <final output name>` and then run immediately (the program need not
        be linked, it is executable).
